# TMLC-MEGA-GUIDED-PROJECTS
TMLC is conducting a program on Machine Learning Projects, Where they will showcase various projects and deplyment and maintenace methods.
In this program they will touch upon data exploration, data mamgement and make ready for various  Machine learning algorithm based on python.

### Guided RTA analysis
This data contains traffic related data like driver details , road condition , days weather etc, task is to build classification model to predict 
accidents like minor ,sever, medium 


### Income equality 
It is classifier problem on income inequality. The data set has 209k records and 43 columns. In this data set there are many fields with string values and many numerical values.
Some of the columns is not necessary for classification, We drop those columns ,and apply the encoder.  There are two ipnyb files one is regular and another one is small. Regular 
one is traditional way to build the model and in last find most important features who are contributing most and build stremit operation . There is stream lit application attached 
to it. The smaller one is the model build by top 10 contributing fetures
